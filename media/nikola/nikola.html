          <h2 id="head">The Beginning</h2>
          <p id="body">Tesla designed the alternating-current (AC) electrical system, which quickly became
            the preeminent power system of the 20th century and has remained the worldwide standard ever
            since.<br>
            As interest in an AC system grew, Tesla and Westinghouse were put in direct competition with
            Thomas Edison, who was intent on selling his direct-current (DC) system to the nation.
            A negative press campaign was soon waged by Edison, in an attempt to undermine interest in AC power.<br>
            Tesla arrived in New York in 1884 and was hired as an engineer at Thomas Edison’s Manhattan headquarters.
            He worked there for a year, impressing Edison with his diligence and ingenuity.
            At one point Edison told Tesla he would pay $50,000 for an improved design for his DC dynamos.
            After months of experimentation, Tesla presented a solution and asked for the money.
            Edison demurred, saying, “Tesla, you don’t understand our American humor.” Tesla quit soon after.

          <h2 id="head">The Genius</h2>
          <p id="body">Tesla studied math and physics at the Technical University of Graz and philosophy at the University of Prague.
            In 1882, while on a walk, he came up with the idea for a brushless AC motor, making the first sketches of its rotating electromagnets in the sand of the path.
            Later that year he moved to Paris and got a job repairing direct current (DC) power plants with the Continental Edison Company.
            Two years later he immigrated to the United States. <br>Nikola Tesla is considered one of the most innovative and mysterious
            men who ever lived. If Tesla hadn’t invented and researched everything he did in his time, our technology today would be
            considerably worse.<br>
            He is one of the most amazing inventors our civilization has ever known his knowledge and ideas went far and beyond what was
            known and accepted in his lifetime. </p>

          <h2 id="head">The Rivalry</h2>
          <p id="body">The dispute between Tesla and Edison centered on which type of electric current should become the universal
            standard in the United States. Edison preferred direct current (DC), which was already widely
            used (and which Edison was profiting off of through his patents). But DC had a key drawback:
            It was difficult to convert the low voltage from power plants into high-voltage transmission
            lines that could carry electricity long distances. <br>So a DC system would require many smaller
            power plants built close to users.Tesla's alternating current (AC) system fixed this problem.
            Using transformers, the voltages could be raised and lowered, making it possible to have power
            plants many miles from wherever power was being used. <br>Tesla sold his patents to George Westinghouse,
            who promoted the new AC system against Edison's.By 1896, General Electric had ditched DC for AC,
            which eventually became the dominant system in the United States. </p>

          <h2 id="head">The Struggle</h2>
          <p id="body">The resulting "current wars" did turn into a genuine rivalry — at least for a while.
            Edison launched a publicity campaign to promote DC, which included public displays of AC electrocution in front of a live audience.
            In 1903, Edison supervised workers as they electrocuted an elephant named Topsy.
            <br>
            In June 1888 year Harold P. Brown, a New York electrical engineer,
            claimed that alternating current was more dangerous than direct current and tried to prove this by publicly killing animals with both currents,
            with technical assistance from Edison Electric.<br> The Edison company and Brown colluded further in their parallel goals to limit the use of AC with
            attempts to push through legislation to severely limit AC installations and voltages. <br>Both also colluded with Westinghouse's chief AC rival, t
            he Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator.

          <h2 id="head">The Celebrity</h2>
          <p id="body">The Tesla Coil, The Magnifying Transmitter, The Tesla Turbine, The Shadowgraph, The Radio, The Neon Lamp, The Niagara Falls Transformer House,
            The Tesla Motor, The Radio Controlled Boat, The Alternating Current are few Tesla Inventions of over 300 patents. Thomas Edison and Tesla were mentioned
            in a press dispatch as potential laureates to share the Nobel Prize of 1915, leading to one of several Nobel Prize controversies. <br>
            Some sources have claimed that because of their animosity toward each other neither was given the award, despite their scientific contributions;
            that each sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award; that both refused to ever accept the award if the other received it first;
            and that both rejected any possibility of sharing it. At the time of Tesla's life, ionizing radiation and electromagnetism were heavily studied subjects.
            His early experiments with x-ray imaging eventually led to its implementation in the medical field.<br>

          <h2 id="head">The Success</h2>
          <p id="body">The discovery of x-rays was one that Tesla found through his quest to understand the unseen forces in the world around him.
            This drive ultimately is what made Tesla such a profoundly amazing inventor.<br>One of Tesla's greatest inventions and predictions of the
            future was that of wireless data and energy transmission. J.P. Morgan company invested $150,000 into Tesla's idea of wireless transmission with
            the goal of finding frequencies which data could transmit across. The tower that Tesla built was the world's first wireless transmission system,
            and his ideas in this field laid the groundwork for the possibility of modern wireless data and revolutionised the world with AC current.
            <br> Tesla's genius will go down in history. He was the author of numerous books,
            developed and designed many devices, but still died in poverty, in January 1943, at the age of 86. </p>
